## My process

I started with a new React (Typescript + Vite) project, and incorporated in a centered element, the provided qr image, into a card element (using the [Chakra UI library](https://chakra-ui.com/)).

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)

### What I learned

Mainly, I've learned two things:
- How to handle (although superficially), the Chakra UI library.

- Implement some responsive design through Breakpoints.
